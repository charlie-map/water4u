water4u

A web app that will allow to input your phone number to receive reminders to drink water!
This project idea came to me after forgetting for multiple days.

Setup steps:
1. git clone https link.
2. npm install packages
3. copy databases changes from CREATE_DB.sql
4. make a twilio account and add number at: https://www.twilio.com/login
5. run node server.js to start
